              <p>This License Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) is a legal contract between you (both as an individual,
                and on behalf of your employer and any Teradata-authorized licensee for whom you and/or your employer
                are acting on their behalf) and Teradata Corporation (&quot;Teradata&quot;) for the applicable Teradata

                yourself, and on behalf of your employer and any Teradata-authorized licensee for whom you and/or your

              <p>1.&nbsp; Term. &nbsp;This Agreement commences on the earliest date of the first download, first
                copying, first installation, or first use of the Software. This Agreement, including your license to the
                Software, will expire or terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration or termination of any applicable
                underlying agreement between you and Teradata (such as a partnership or customer agreement) or (ii)
                termination in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>

              <p>2.&nbsp; License.&nbsp;</p>

                the Software, (ii) testing the interoperability of the Software with computer applications that you have
                independently developed or separately acquired for your own internal use, or (iii) led-training by you
                or a Teradata instructor and/or (y) facilitating your use of other&nbsp;Teradata-related products and
                services.(b)&nbsp; The term &quot;Third Party Software&quot; means computer programs or modules
                (including their documentation) that bear the logo, copyright and/or trademark of a third party
                (including open source software that are contained in files marked as &ldquo;open source&rdquo; or the
                like) or are otherwise subject to written license terms.&nbsp; Third Party Software does not constitute
                Software.&nbsp; Third Party Software is licensed to you subject to the applicable license terms
                accompanying it, included in/with it, referenced in it, or otherwise entered into by you with respect to
                it.&nbsp;</p>

                the right to inspect your use of the Software for purposes of verifying your compliance with the terms
                and conditions of this Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <p>(e) The Software may contain a disabling device that will prevent the Software from being used on data
                sets larger than a certain size.&nbsp; You agree not to: (i) use the Software on data sets larger than

                support, or maintenance of any kind (collectively and individually, &quot;Services&quot;). To the extent
                that Teradata elects to provide you with any Services, such Services are provided to you at
                Teradata&#39;s sole discretion and may be modified or discontinued at any time for any reason.&nbsp;</p>

                SOFTWARE, AND (C) PROVIDES THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE TO YOU HEREUNDER ON AN &quot;AS-IS&quot; BASIS WITHOUT

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>5.&nbsp; LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY: UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL TERADATA&#39;S AND ITS LICENSORS&#39;
                TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICES, THE SOFTWARE, AND/OR

                DATA, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS RESTRICT LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT FULLY APPLY TO
                YOU.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>6.&nbsp; Government Restrictions. You agree that you will not, directly or indirectly, export or
                transmit any Software without obtaining Teradata&#39;s prior written authorization, as well as
                appropriate governmental approvals, including those required by the U.S. Government.&nbsp; Use and or
                distribution of this software is subject to export laws and regulations of the United States and other
                jurisdictions. The links below connect you to applicable U.S. government agencies, and their
                regulations, that have jurisdiction over this transaction.</p>

              <p>http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>By installing, downloading, or using this product, you acknowledge that this transaction is subject to
                applicable export control laws and you certify that your installation,&nbsp; download, use and/or
                subsequent distribution of this product is not prohibited under applicable laws and regulations.</p>

              <p>The Government&#39;s use, duplication, or disclosure of Teradata&#39;s commercial computer software and
                commercial computer software documentation is subject to: (a) the Restricted Rights Notice set forth in
                48 C.F.R. &para; 52.227-14 (Rights In Data - General); (b) Teradata&#39;s standard commercial license
                rights supplemented by 48 C.F.R. &para; 52.227-19 (Commercial Computer Software - Restricted Rights);
                and/or (c) the limited rights and license set forth 48 CFR &para; 252.227-7015 (Technical
                Data-Commercial Items), as applicable.</p>

              <p>7.&nbsp; Termination and Expiration. A party may terminate this Agreement with or without cause, upon
                providing written notice to the other parties.&nbsp; When this Agreement terminates or expires, you will
                immediately cease all use of the Software, permanently remove the Software from all computers, destroy
                all copies of the Software, and (upon receipt of Teradata&rsquo;s request) provide a signed written
                certification that the foregoing has occurred.&nbsp; Sections 4-11 will survive expiration or
                termination of this Agreement.</p>

              <p>8.&nbsp; Choice of Law and Dispute Resolution. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve any
                controversy or claim by negotiation or mediation.&nbsp; If they are unable to do so, and regardless of
                the causes of action alleged and whether they arise under this Agreement or otherwise, the claim will be
                resolved by arbitration before a sole arbitrator in San Diego, California pursuant to the then-current
                Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association and the federal substantive and procedural law
                of arbitration.&nbsp; The arbitrator&rsquo;s award will be final and binding, and may be entered in any
                court having jurisdiction thereof, but may include only damages consistent with the limitations in this
                Agreement.&nbsp; Each party will bear its own attorney&#39;s fees and costs related to the arbitration.
                The obligations to negotiate, mediate and arbitrate shall not apply to claims for misuse or infringement
                of a party&rsquo;s intellectual property rights.&nbsp; Any claim or action must be brought within two
                years after the claimant knows or should have known of the claim.&nbsp; New York law will govern the
                interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement, except that the Federal Arbitration Act will govern
                the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitrability of claims under this Section.</p>

              <p>9.&nbsp; Feedback.&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary: (a) Teradata will have no obligation
                of any kind with respect to any Software-related comments, suggestions, design changes or improvements
                that you elect to provide to Teradata in either verbal or written form (collectively, &quot;Software
                Feedback&quot;), and (b) Teradata and its affiliates are hereby free to use any ideas, concepts,
                know-how or techniques, in whole or in part, contained in Software Feedback: (i) for any purpose
                whatsoever, including developing, manufacturing, and/or marketing products and/or services
